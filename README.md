Overview
Our project demonstrates how to build a blockchain from scratch using JavaScript. By following this guide, you will learn the inner workings of a blockchain and its key components, such as hashing, blocks, and blockchain management.
Installation
To set up the project:
Clone the repository:
Install the required dependencies:
Components
The project consists of the following components:
config.js: Logic for the genesis block (the first block in the blockchain).
crypto_hash.js: Generates a unique cryptographic hash code based on block data.
block.js: Defines the structure and functionality of a block.
blockchain.js: Manages the blockchain, including adding blocks and resolving conflicts.
average_time.js: Calculates the average time taken to mine a block.
index.js: Connects blockchain nodes in a network and enables interaction via a web server.
Usage
To use the blockchain:
Open the Redis server.
Open the Postman application.
Run index.js for the admin node: npm run dev.
Run index.js for other nodes: npm run dev-peer.
Installation and Configuration
You will need:
Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
Postman: Install Postman to send requests and interact with the blockchain.
Redis: Set up a Redis server for node communication.
Modules: Install required modules (redis@2.8.0, cross-env@5.2.0, request@2.88.0).
