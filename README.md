## Overview

Our blockchain implementation is built entirely using JavaScript, making it accessible and easy to understand. By following this project, you will gain insights into the inner workings of a blockchain and learn about concepts such as hashing, blocks, and the blockchain itself.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-project.git
2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-project.git

3. Start the project:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-project.git

## Components

The project consists of the following components:

- `config.js`: Implements the logic for the genesis block, which is the first block in the blockchain.
- `crypto_hash.js`: Generates a unique cryptographic hash code based on the block's timestamp, previous hash, and data.
- `block.js`: Defines the structure and functionality of a block in the blockchain.
- `blockchain.js`: Manages the blockchain, including adding blocks, verifying the chain, and resolving conflicts.
- `average_time.js`: Calculates the average time taken to mine a block in the blockchain.
- `index.js`: Connects the blockchain nodes in a network and enables interaction via a web server.

## Usage

Once you have the project up and running, you can perform the following actions:

- Mine new blocks and add them to the blockchain.
- Verify the integrity of the blockchain by validating each block's hash.
- Resolve conflicts between different nodes in the network.
- Calculate the average time taken to mine a block.

To interact with the blockchain, you can use the provided API endpoints or integrate the blockchain into your own applications.
